# Brunel-with-optical-input

This package simulates a Brunel network (two populations of point neurons) that receives input from an LGN population, which again receives "optical" input from retinal ganglion cells. The Local Field Potential (LFP) is then calculated from the spiking activity using hybridLFPy.

The network essentially simulates an eye that sends information to the visual cortex where an electrode is recording the electric field generated from the resulting neural activity.
